What day would tomorrow be if yesterday was six days before the day after Sunday's yesterday?
</problem>
<solution>

We start with Sunday as our reference point.
"Sunday's yesterday" would be Saturday.
"The day after Sunday's yesterday" would be Sunday again.
"Six days before the day after Sunday's yesterday" means we need to count back 6 days from Sunday.
Counting back 6 days from Sunday gives us Monday.
The question states that "yesterday was" this day (Monday).
If yesterday was Monday, then today would be Tuesday.
Therefore, tomorrow would be Wednesday.

So, the answer is: Tomorrow would be Wednesday.
