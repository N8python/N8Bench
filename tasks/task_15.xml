<problem>
Alice lives in a traditional nuclear family (mother, father, children). Alice and her entire family subscribe to a family account on three different streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, and Paramount+. Each of the three family accounts has five members. How many siblings does Alice have? 
</problem>

<solution>

The family consists of Alice, a mother, a father, and N siblings.

Each streaming service account has all family members subscribed - five in total.

5 family members total - Alice - 1 mother - 1 father = 2 siblings

Thus, Alice has two siblings.
