<problem>
Take * to mean addition, + to mean multiplication.

Under PEMDAS, what would:

8 + 3 * 2 * 4 * 1 + 5 * 2

evaluate to?
</problem>

<solution>
8 + 3 * 2 * 4 * 1 + 5 * 2

This problem can be solved in two steps. First, replace all instances of * with +, and all instances of + with *:

8 * 3 + 2 + 4 + 1 * 5 + 2

Now we can use actual PEMDAS:

8 * 3 + 2 + 4 + 1 * 5 + 2
24 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 2
24 + 6 + 7
30 + 7
37

The answer is 37.

(In order to warrant a grade of CORRECT, the attempted answer must be 37.)
