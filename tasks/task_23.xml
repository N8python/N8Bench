<problem>

A man named Joe sees the following equation of a piece of paper.

6 + 6 = 81

He says - "this makes no sense!" and gives it to his friend Jane.

Jane looks at the paper for a second, does something to it, and hands it back to Joe.

Joe then says, "Never mind, this is correct."

What did Jane do to the paper?

<solution>

Jane turned the paper upside down. When the paper is turned upside down, the equation reads:

18 = 9 + 9

Which is correct.
