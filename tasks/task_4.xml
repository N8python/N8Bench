<problem>
A boy and his mother go for a drive (the father is at work) - and end up in a tragic accident. The mother dies, and the boy is rushed to the hospital.

When the doctor arrives, the doctor says, "I can't operate on this boy - he's my son."

How is this possible?
</problem>

<solution>
The boy has a mother and father. The mother just died in a car crash. By process of elimination, the doctor is the boy's father.
