<problem>
A cylindrical container is filled with water. The water is then poured equally into three new containers. These three new containers have the following properties:

They are identical to each other.
The three containers cannot be arranged to perfectly occupy the same space as the original cylinder.
The water fits perfectly in these new containers without overflowing or being underfilled, or gravity causing the water to flow out.

What shape must these three new containers have?
</problem>

<solution>
The volume of the cylinder must be equal to the volume of the three new containers combined, due to the water being an incompressible liquid under normal conditions - thus conserving volume.

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The volume of a cone is given by the formula V = (1/3)πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Thus the volume of three cones is that of one cylinder.

Three cones can not be arranged in a way that perflecty occupies the same space as the original cylinder.

Thus three identical containers with the same height and radius as the cylinder must be cones.
