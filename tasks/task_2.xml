<problem>
A nxn square of discrete dots has 20 dots with less than 9 neighbors. How many dots are there, total, in the square?
</problem>

<solution>
In a square grid of dots, the dots with less than 9 neighbors are:

4 corner dots (each with 3 neighbors)
(n-2)*4 edge dots (each with 5 neighbors)

We're told that there are 20 such dots. So we can write an equation:
4 + (n-2)*4 = 20

Solving this equation:

(n-2) * 4 = 16

n - 2 = 4

n = 6

So our square is 6x6 - meaning there are 36 dots total in the square.
