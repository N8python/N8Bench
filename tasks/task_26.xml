<problem>
There are cats in a drawer shaped like a regular polygon. Each cat is in a corner at the bottom part of the drawer, and each cat sees three other cats - two an equal distance away, and one farther away. How many sides does the drawer have?
</problem>
<solution>

Each cat can be thought of as a vertex that can see 3 other vertices.

If the drawer is shaped like a square, the cat will see two cats an equal distance away - the cats at the adjacent corners of the square - and one cat further away - the cat opposite it diagonally.

Therefore, the drawer is a square, and it thus has 4 sides.
