If all Swaffs are Cools, all Cools are Swells, and all Swells are Dudes, then is it safe to say all Dudes are Swaffs?
</problem>

<solution>

The relationships provided indicate subsets - so Swaffs are a subset of Cools, Cools are a subset of Swells, and Swells are a subset of Dudes.

However, this doesn't go the other way - Dudes aren't all Swaffs. They could be, but the information provided doesn't guarantee that.

Therefore, it is not safe to say all Dudes are Swaffs.
