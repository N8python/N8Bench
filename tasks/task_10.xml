<problem>
There are six girls - Alice, Jesse, Bertha, Maria, Claire, and Penelope. They are all each other's **only** friends. They are all currently performing an activity in the same room.

Alice is writing a trilogy of stories with some of her friends at the moment - with each friend writing one story. Claire is playing chess with a friend. Penelope is illiterate. Bertha is playing a video game.

What is each girl doing?
</problem>

<solution>
Alice, as stated, is writing a story.

Penelope is illiterate - so she cannot be writing the story with alice.

Claire is playing chess.

Bertha is playing a computer game.

That leaves Penelope, Jesse, and Maria.

Penelope can't be writing the book with Alice, so that leaves Jesse and Maria to complete the trilogy.

Claire needs someone to play chess with - that must be Penelope.

So therefore:

Alice - writing story
Jesse - writing story
Maria - writing story
Claire - playing chess
Penelope - playing chess
Bertha - playing video game
