<problem>
Yelena tells Alice that Joseph has nice hair. Yelena then goes up to Joseph and tells him that she made him look good in front of Alice - that she highlighted his hair. Alice mishears what Yelena said as Joseph having lice in his hair - and she is disgusted by the thought of being near him. In his next interaction with Alice, is Joseph likely to start out confident about his hair?
</problem>

<solution>
Jacob knows that Yelena told Alice that he has nice hair, and he is unaware of Alice's misinterpretation. Therefore, he would not expect Alice to be disgusted by his hair. He would likely start out confident about his hair in his next interaction with Alice.
